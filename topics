1. PureComponent is optimized version of component
which implements shouldComponentUpdate method with shallow comparison of props and state.

If we draw a list of items based on props and if parent component re-renders and we have props
reference change, items component will re-render but if we use PureComponent, the shallow comparison will happen
and it will prevent unnecessary re-render

2. There can be some cases when context will not trigger re-render, and shouldComponentUpdate can't be triggered to
understand whether the component needs to be updated

3. There are a few ways to pass information from child component to parent component: callback functions, context api
or state management tools like redux ...

4. To prevent re-rendering component in React we can use React.memo HOC which will compare prev and new props and
determine if component needs to be updated and even we can pass custom function to compare props with custom logic.
Another way is using shouldComponent update in class components

5. React fragment is feature to prevent adding unnecessary wrapper elements and reducing elements can help performance
of application also.

6. We use HOCs to share some common logic and we can consider usage of HOCs in situations like:
HOC for authentication/permissions, for themes or for common animations
